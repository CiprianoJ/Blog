Title: Movie

The movie we watched in class *Objectified* was great insight into how designers think. They look at things everyday and think about how they can make them better. One of the most important things they look at isn't the things itself, but instead how people use it. How can it become more efficient?
I'd never really thought about how much designers really need to take into consideration when making products.
