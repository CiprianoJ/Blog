Film Deconstruction
---
I love watching movies it's the best pass time. I decided to look at two films and deconsruct the scenes. The two films that I
picked are [Breakfast at Tiffany’s directed by Blake Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52kC2KKpUT0&index=2&list=PLuoTtPxIOh1P-xJ-lcjxZOE2MKrI6P0lM)
and [Twilight directed by Catherine Hardwicke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWiQPqbFqo). The movie that I liked 
the most was Breakfast at Tiffany’s and one that I wish I’d never wasted anytime seeing was Twilight. I picked the scene where 
the couple meets for the first time.The lighting and color is one of the most important aspects of a film because it sets an 
aesthetic and the mood for the scene. In Breakfast at Tiffany’s we see more vibrant colors with the accent pieces of furniture
Holly has in her apartment. The eye mask she is wearing and the earplugs she has on. The fruit basket also adds a nice pop of 
color. There is natural lighting that comes from the windows in her apartment as well. Overall it’s very lively and gives off 
this glamours lifestyle vibe Holly lives because the lighting is nice in the apartment making it look more spacious and the 
colors playing on the neutral tones give a more upbeat glamours feel to her apartment. As a viewer I am very drawn to what is 
happening in the scene because it’s visually appealing to look at. Twilight fails to do this because the lighting is very poor
and it’s dark. I don’t want to keep watching the movie because it gives off sadness. The colors are very dark, and at 0:09 her 
the character that Ana Kendrick plays has on a  coral shirt, but it seems sad and dark to look at even though it is supposed 
to be a vibrant color. It’s just not intriguing enough. Breakfast at Tiffany’s has more varying shots and it helps keep the viewer 
engaged.There are full shots, wide shots, over-the- shoulder shots, close-ups, medium shots, and medium close up shots, reactionary 
shots. In comparison the twilight scene only has medium, medium close-up, full shots, reactionary shots. Since Breakfast at Tiffany’s 
has more variation it is able to engage more people. I think that Twilight fails to not only the variation but they’re not as interesting.
They don’t really have many interesting things to put in the frames it’s just people and there are no interesting backgrounds so it’s just
not very entertaining to look at. In Breakfast at Tiffany’s you’re getting more than just a person talking, there are scenes where Holly
is doing things or Paul is doing things. When they are in the shot so is their background and it’s more interesting because 
they move around the apartment.The acting in Breakfast at Tiffany’s is far better, it’s not cringy to watch and both characters
are interesting from the beginning. You’re intrigued by them and the way they are presented is so intriguing you want to know 
more about them. The staging is so much better because they move around and have more interesting outfits that allow you to 
get to know the kinds of people they are. Holly is constantly moving in the scene which is very true to her character because 
she always has so much happening in her life and in her head. Twilight just didn’t have the same effect to me because the 
acting was very bad. The scene where Edward is staring at Bella in the lab is laughable and not very convincing. The only 
takeaway is why does he look at her like that and you don’t even want to know more about either because both characters just 
seem boring. They’re too plain there is nothing interesting about the way they look or dress. The staging is very boring they 
never actually move around until Bella goes to sit next to Edward and as the Cullens come into the lunch room. It’s too limited
and it’s easy to look away because you don’t think you’ll miss anything since they’re in the same spot and the only thing changing 
is the dialogue.
